The stereo calibration RMS error of 136.59 is calculated during the cv2.stereoCalibrate() function call. Let me explain what this error means and why it's so high in your case:
How the Error is Calculated
When OpenCV performs stereo calibration:

It identifies corresponding chessboard corners in both left and right images
Using the calculated camera matrices, distortion coefficients, rotation, and translation parameters, it projects the 3D points back onto both image planes
It then calculates the distance (in pixels) between the original detected corners and these reprojected points
The Root Mean Square (RMS) of all these distances across all points is reported as the calibration error

A well-calibrated stereo system typically has an RMS error of less than 1 pixel. Your individual camera calibrations look good (0.81 and 0.84 pixels), but the stereo calibration error is much higher.
Why Your Error is So High
Several factors are likely contributing to your high calibration error:

Camera Misalignment: The large rotation matrix values and significant Y/Z components in your translation vector indicate that your cameras aren't aligned in a standard stereo configuration. This makes it difficult for the calibration algorithm to find a good transformation between the two views.
Physical Setup: The values in your translation vector suggest your cameras might be in a very unusual configuration:

X (baseline): 184 mm (reasonable)
Y: 520 mm (extremely high vertical offset)
Z: 518 mm (extremely high depth offset)


Chessboard Visibility: If the chessboard appears very different in the left and right images due to the unusual camera positions, this makes it harder to establish precise correspondences.
GoPro Wide-Angle Lenses: The wide-angle lenses on GoPro cameras introduce significant distortion, which can make stereo calibration more challenging, especially at the edges of the image.

Improving Calibration
To reduce this error:

Camera Positioning: Mount the cameras side-by-side with their optical axes parallel. Minimize vertical offset and depth differences. Use a rigid mount to ensure consistent relative positions.
Chessboard Pattern: Use a larger chessboard pattern attached to a rigid, flat surface (like a wooden board). Ensure it's completely flat.
Calibration Process:

Take images where the chessboard covers different parts of the field of view
Include images where the chessboard is at different distances and angles
Ensure good, consistent lighting with no reflections
Keep the chessboard completely visible in both cameras for all images


Try ArUco Markers: ArUco markers can be more reliable for calibration, especially with GoPro cameras. The code for this is already in your project.

Alternatives
If you can't get better alignment between your cameras, consider:

Monocular Depth: Use a single camera with monocular depth estimation (the MiDaS model already in your project)
Camera Reconfiguration: Reposition the cameras to achieve a more standard stereo setup (side-by-side, parallel optical axes)
Specialized Calibration: Use a more advanced calibration method designed for wide-angle lenses or non-standard camera configurations

Despite the high error, you can still proceed with depth estimation using your current calibration. The results may not be as accurate as desired, but you can use them as a starting point and improve the setup based on those initial results.
